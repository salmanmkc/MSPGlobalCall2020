# MSP Virtual Call TBC 2020

![I'll put an image here :D - Salman](README_Images/inspirecast.png)

A call led by MSP Inspire, our initiative is to grow and expand the awareness of the MSP program. We are aiming to encorporate as many MSPs to talk as possible, as well as industry experts, MVPs, and reseachers. Right now we are in the planning stages, so if you would like to get involved drop an email: 13schishti@gmail.com

## The aims of this call

- **To make learning accessible to everyone:** As students we are continously learning and growing, we aim to  grow the reach of lectuers and spread the knowledge to make it accessible wherever you are.
- **Build a network:** We hope to build a strong network and keep as many of you tightly-knit within this community to continue do good for others.
- **Exposure to other fields:** Universities will cover certain aspects within a subject, however not all aspects or modules are shown. This would be a good way to give viewers an introduction into many fields.
- **Less pressure:** We know that universities will have deadlines and shape their courses around exams, but having the chance to show people things that you yourself are passionate about comes much easier, and with less pressure.

>**Note**: The date is not finalised yet, however we are planning towards TBC at the moment.
